%In this view, we don't need to let the coefficient field of
%our differential polynomials be a function space.  We can restrict the coefficients to be constants;
%all that is required is that the constants embed nicely into our function space
%when it comes time to multiply them by functions.


%We can define {\it differential ideals}, which are like polynomial
%ideals, but are also closed under derivation.  This models
%our analytic operation of differentiation where any derivative
%of the zero function is the zero function, so if a differential
%polynomial is equal to zero (and therefore a member of the ideal),
%its derivations are also equal to zero and also members of the
%differential ideal.

%We can reduce modulo a differential ideal.  When you think about the difficulty
%of reducing modulo a polynomial ideal (i.e, specifying a term ordering,
%computing a Gr\"obner basis), it is not surprising that this is
%not trivial.  The Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner algorithm probably
%provides the nearest differential algebra analog to Buchberger's algorithm.

We can define {\it differential ideals}, which are like polynomial
ideals, but are also closed under derivation.  This models
our analytic operation of differentiation where any derivative
of the zero function is the zero function.
We can consider {\it differential varieties}, the solution surfaces in our function space,
composed of all of the functions that solve all of the differential equations in
a given differential variety.
In standard commutative algebra, a primary decomposition of the radical of an ideal into prime ideals leads
to the decomposition of the corresponding varieties into the union of irreducible varieties.
We can consider something like a primary decomposition of a differential ideal.
The Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner algorithm probably
provides the nearest differential algebra analog to primary decomposition,
decomposing the radical of a differential ideal into the intersection of regular differential ideals.

From BLOPv2:

ordinary polynomials:

We have an ordering on the indeterminates.

The leader of $p$ is the greatest indeterminate $x \in X$ w.r.t. R which
appears in $p$

A subset A of $R \\ K$ is said to be triangular if the leaders of its elements are
pairwise different.


Denote rank p = $v^d$ .

The differential polynomial q is said to be partially reduced w.r.t. p if no
proper derivative of v appears in q; it is said to be reduced w.r.t. p if q is
partially reduced w.r.t. p and deg(q, v) < d. A set A ⊂ R \ K is said to be
autoreduced if any element of A is reduced w.r.t. any other element of the
set.
Definition 13. - A set $A \in R \\ K$ is said to be differentially triangular if
it is triangular and if its elements are pairwise partially reduced.


Definition 17. — (critical pairs)
A set ${p_1 , p_2 }$ of differential polynomials is said to be a critical pair if the
leaders of $p_1$ and $p_2$ have common derivatives. If A is a set of differential
polynomials then critical-pairs(A) denotes the set of all the pairs which can
be formed between any two elements of A.


Definition 22. — (regular differential systems)
A differential system $A = 0, S \ne 0$ of a differential polynomial ring R is
said to be a regular differential system (for a ranking R) if
\begin{itemize}
\item[C1] A is differentially triangular,
\item[C2] S contains the separants of the elements of A and is partially reduced
w.r.t. A,
\item[C3] all the ${p, p_0 } \in$ critical-pairs(A) are solved by $A = 0, S \ne 0$ (coherence property).
\end{itemize}

The differential ideal $[A] : S \infty$ is called the regular differential ideal defined by the system.

If $A$ is a system of ordinary polynomial equations, then its separants are all zero,
it has no critical pairs, and differentially triangular is simply triangular.
Very much like a characteristic set.


Nevertheless, the results of these algorithms can be somewhat disappointing,
at least for those accustomed to working with algebraic ideals and Gr\"obner bases.
Rarely does a differential polynomial decomposition lead to a nice set of equations that easily represent all of our solutions,
and for good reason.

Until now, we have not discussed boundary conditions at all, because there are none.
%Boundary conditions
%are generally imposed globally (what does this mean?), while differential
%equations express strictly local behavior.  
Differential equations express strictly local behavior; no boundary conditions
can be imposed simply by adding differential polynomials to a differential algebra system.
No boundary conditions implies that our solution varieties contain all
possible solutions of the differential equations, with any boundary conditions whatsoever.

Therefore, any equations derived from a Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner calculation would apply
to all such possible solutions (not true - how about the regular ideals?),
and there are few equations that would apply in such broad generality,
to all solutions of a differential equation no matter what the boundary conditions.

What about the function field?  Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner is an algrebraic algorithm,
much like primary decomposition is a commutative algebra technique.  It's
equally valid in all function fields (that map somehow into our cofficients).






An algorithm begins to suggest itself.  To solve any given PDE,
we pick a small function field
parameterized by a finite number of constants, describe it using a
system of differential polynomial equations, append the original PDE to this system, and use
the Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner algorithm to describe this resulting system
as an intersection of regular differential ideals.







To work with my limited reduction algorithm, there are some additional requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item new indeterminates must be either constant, algebraic, or ODE
\item the deriviations of constants, by definition, are zero
\item algebraic elements must be specified using an minimum polynomial, which may includes constants
\item derivations of algebraic elements are completely defined by their minimum polynomial
\item ODE indeterminates are paired.  Each ODE extension is defined using two indeterminates,
the dependent and the independant variable.  The dependent variable is specified using a minimum differential
equation which only involves derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variable.
\item derivations of the independant variable are completely defined in terms of derivations of the
dependent variable using the chain rule.  If $\Psi$ is the independent variable and $v$ is the dependent
variable, then $\Psi_x = \Psi_v v_x$
\item the new inderminates must be specified in differential triangular form, or as a tower of extensions
\end{itemize}

Algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
\item form a differentially triangular set that describes the ansatz
\item reduce (which reduction?) the PDE modulo the differentially triangular set
\item collect like terms
\item form a system of polynomial equations in the constants
\end{itemize}

triangular - it's like a tower; each equation introduces a new variable (i.e, leaders are different),
  but in differential algebra, it could introduce new derivations of the same variable
     $v_x$ = nothing involving v
     $v_y$ = nothing involving v (this is fine, they're pairwise partially reduced, since no proper derivative of $v_x$ or $v_y$ appears in the other)
     $v_xx$ = ... (this is a problem; $v_x$ now has a proper derivative here)

What does it take for my cancellation scheme to work?
   - it must be a tower, more or less, so triangular (more or less)
   - each algebraic element must be introduced with a minimal polynomial, that will be used to cancel the leader's power and higher powers of leader
   - each ODE element is introduced with a differential polynomial w.r.t. a new variable v
   - v's first derivatives are all specified using the chain rule

How hard is it to introduce a new independent variable?
   - an equation written using derivatives w.r.t. the new independent can be written as $v_a = v_x x_a$

How to introduce a new ODE?

\begin{itemize}
\item We wish to avoid introducing new derivations.
\item We introduce new symbols, $\Psi$, $\Psi'$, $\Psi'', v$
\item $\Psi$ is described by a minimal differential polynomial involving only $\Psi''$, $\Psi'$, $\Psi$, and $v$.
\item We define the derivations of $\Psi$ and $\Psi'$ using the chain rule: $\Psi_x = \Psi' v_x$; $\Psi'_x = \Psi'' v_x$
\item The derivations of $\Psi''$ are now completely defined by its minimal differential polynomial
(assuming that polynomial is first degree in $\Psi''$, and its initial involves only $v$)
(the derivations would be defined even without this restriction, but might involve $\Psi''$ itself)
(the assumption allows $\Psi''$ to eliminated by differential reduction)
\end{itemize}


Expressing an ansatz using differential polynomials seems natural within the context of differential algebra,
but is even more important if we wish to systematize this algorithm using
something like the Rosenfeld-Gr\"obner algorithm to perform a differential reduction step.

Requiring the parameters to be constants and placing them only in the coefficients
of the differential polynomials ensures that we can ultimately reduce the problem
of finding solutions within this parametized function space to systems
of polynomial equations
amenable to the techniques of algebraic geometry.









%We start with the base ring/field that is used to construct the PDE itself, then form
%a finite tower of field extensions in which we will search for our solution.  This
%is totally in the spirit of Liouville's theorem, which uses a finite tower
%of algebraic/exponential/logarithmic extensions to define an elementary differential
%extension, and differential Galois theory, which uses a finite tower of
%algebraic/exponential/integral extensions to define a liouvillian extension.

For our tower, there are two types of admissible extensions: algebraic and ODE.

%Algebraic extensions are formed by adjoining a primitive element which solves
%an irreducible algebraic equation (the minimal polynomial) with coefficients
%in the underlying field.  An algebraic extension of a differential field
%admits only a single unique way of extending the derivations, so the minimal
%polynomial is the only information required to specify the extension.
%Since algebraic extensions lead naturally
%to nonlinear ODE extensions, if I wish to include algebraic extensions with
%linear ODEs, they must be included explicitly (and are).

% Note: This definition of holonomic extension may not match with the D-module literature.  Check this.

%We tend to take the algebraic view, extract as much information as possible,
%then switch to analysis.

A {\it ODE tower} is a differential field extension
constructed from a finite number of algebraic and/or ODE extensions.

Our ansatzen are formed from ODE towers with degree bounds on all
distinguished variables and coefficients.  Other ansatzen can be
conceived of using non-linear ODEs or non-ODE extensions; they
are outside the scope of the present work.

No algorithm is presently available to select an ansatz.

I use a graphical notation to describe an ansatz.  Blue-purple boxes
denote rings, orange boxes (whether shaded orange or not) denote ODE extensions, and green boxes denote
algebraic extensions.  A blue box drawn immediately around an orange or green box
denote the ring formed by adjoining the element defined by the orange or green box.
Polynomials are drawn as a square white box and are
connected by a line to the ring to which they belong.  A number next to
the line indicates a degree bound on the polynomial, and two numbers
separated by a slash denote a rational function.  For example, 2/2 denotes
a rational function with a second degree numerator and a second degree
denominator.

\begin{comment}
Once the PDEs have been reduced modulo the differential ideal corresponding to a selected ansatz,
the resulting system of polynomial equations must be solved.  The major techniques available are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Exact primary decomposition

This requires the computation of Gr\"obner bases, which often fails due to memory exhaustion
(oom - out of memory) and the limitations of current

\item Numerical approximation (gradient descent / Levenberg-Marquardt)

This requires extraneous ideals/varieties to be removed as they are identified.
I'm currently exploring this approach, as it is the fastest of the three,
using the DHOST algorithm to compute Euclidean Distance polynomials for
identified varieties and use this information to drive the solutions
away from identified varieties in an attempt to find new ones.

Note that this approach, while faster than the others, will never guarantee that all solutions
to the polynomial system have been found.

\item Homotopy continuation

Bertini is a major software program, but Macaulay 2 also supports homotopy continuation.
This technique is slow but, in principle, will identify all irreducible varieties.
In practice, Bertini did not identify all five irreducible varieties for hydrogen Ansatz 5.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

As we've seen, using a parameterized function space allows the use of algebraic geometry
techniques to check a PDE to see if a solution exists in that function space.
Doing so requires putting degree bounds on the various polynomials that form
the ansatz, in contrast to separation of variables, which puts no degree bounds
on the polynomials but requires the solution to be separable.  As we've seen,
even a fairly simple ansatz not only recovered a known separable solution,
but also found a previously unknown solution that is not separable.

Currently, the primary barrier to successful execution of the algorithm is
design limitations in the various software packages used to execute it.
For example, no current Gr\"obner basis algorithms, to my knowledge,
will fall back on using disk-based storage once RAM becomes exhausted.
Run times of weeks or months can be expected when searching for
truly unknown solutions to realistic problems, but no such
calculation is possible if the machine ``runs out of memory'',
even though an ample disk-based backing store may be available.

Any PDE can be explored using this technique.  For studying a
non-linear PDE such as Navier-Stokes, a different set of
ansatzen formed from non-linear ODEs might be advisable.

No theoretical treatment is currently available to predict
when these ansatzen might yield solutions.  The discovery
of a new result using such a simple ansatz suggests, however,
that even very modest degree bounds can yield solutions.

The main thrust of the author's research, however, remains
quantum mechanics and the hope of an ODE-based solution
to helium.  As of May 2023, the author continues to develop
the software tools necessary to check helium ansatz 16.6,
in the hopes of finding a solution to helium's ground state.

Ansatz 1 is the exponential of a first degree polynomial times a first degree polynomial.

It is expected to find the classical 1s and 2s levels of hydrogen, $e^{-r}$ and $(2-r)e^{r/2}$

$A,B \in \mathbf{C}[x,y,z,r]; \deg A \le 1; \deg B \le 1$

$\Psi = A F; F' = F; F_x = B_x F'; F_y = B_y F'; F_z = B_z F'$

or just: $\Psi = A F; F_x = B_x F; F_y = B_y F; F_z = B_z F$

Example: $B=-r; A=1; E=-1/2$ $\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad$ $e^{-r}$

Example: $B=-r/2; A=r-2; E=-1/8$ $\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad$ $(2-r)e^{-r/2}$

Ansatz 5 is a second-order ODE with linear coefficients and a linear variable.

It is expected to find the classical radical equation of hydrogen,
along with the 1s level of hydrogen, $e^{-r}$.

%% $A,B,C,V \in \mathbf{C}[x,y,z,r]; \deg A \le 1; \deg B \le 1; \deg C \le 1; \deg V \le 1$

%% $\Psi = F; A F'' + B F' + C F = 0; F_x = V_x F'; F_y = V_y F'; F_z = V_z F'$

Example: $V=-r; A+C=-B; E=-1/2$ ($A, B, C \in \mathbf{C}$) $\Rightarrow$ $e^{-r}$

Ansatz 11 allows a second-degree algebraic extension to be used in the formation of the distinguished variable.

I don't use it anymore because the quadratic formula tells us that the algebraic element is equivalent
to a square root, which is the simpler Ansatz 16.

Ansatz 16.3 is expected to reproduce $r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$.  A second degree root
is required.

Since $r$ is required to express the known solutions to hydrogen, being able to construct
something else like $r$ makes 16.3 and 16.6 interesting targets.

\subsection*{Appendix: Manual Verification of the Result}
For anybody wondering how Mathematica concludes that \eqref{solution} solves \eqref{schrodinger},
the claim is that $\Psi = J_0(2\sqrt{x+r}) = (J_0 \circ 2\sqrt{v}) (x+r)$ satisfies:

\begin{equation}
\label{claim}
\left(\frac{\delta^2}{\delta^2 x} + \frac{\delta^2}{\delta^2 y} + \frac{\delta^2}{\delta^2 z}\right) \Psi + \frac{2}{r}\Psi = 0
\end{equation}

\vskip 12pt

Letting $v=x+r$, we compute the first partial derivatives of $\Psi$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\delta \Psi}{\delta x} = \frac{d v}{d x} \frac{d}{d v} \left(J_0 \circ 2\sqrt{v}\right) = \frac{d v}{d x} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} \\
\frac{\delta \Psi}{\delta y} = \frac{d v}{d y} \frac{d}{d v} \left(J_0 \circ 2\sqrt{v}\right) = \frac{d v}{d y} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} \\
\frac{\delta \Psi}{\delta z} = \frac{d v}{d z} \frac{d}{d v} \left(J_0 \circ 2\sqrt{v}\right) = \frac{d v}{d z} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\vskip 12pt

Next we compute the partial second derivatives of $\Psi$:

\begin{equation}
\label{second partials}
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\delta^2 \Psi}{\delta x^2} = \frac{d^2 v}{d x^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d x}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d x}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
\frac{\delta^2 \Psi}{\delta y^2} = \frac{d^2 v}{d y^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d y}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d y}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
\frac{\delta^2 \Psi}{\delta z^2} = \frac{d^2 v}{d z^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d z}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d z}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\vskip 12pt

We need to know the derivatives of $v=r+x$ with respect to the coordinates:

\vskip 12pt

\begin{equation}
\label{first v}
\begin{gathered}
\frac{d v}{d x} = \frac{d}{d x} (x+r) = 1 + \frac{x}{r} \\
\frac{d v}{d y} = \frac{d}{d y} (x+r) = \frac{y}{r} \\
\frac{d v}{d z} = \frac{d}{d z} (x+r) = \frac{z}{r}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\vskip 12pt

\begin{equation}
\label{second v}
\begin{gathered}
\frac{d^2 v}{d x^2} = \frac{d}{d x} \left(1 + \frac{x}{r}\right) = \frac{r - x(x/r)}{r^2} = \frac{r^2 - x^2}{r^3} \\
\frac{d^2 v}{d y^2} = \frac{r^2 - y^2}{r^3} \\
\frac{d^2 v}{d z^2} = \frac{r^2 - z^2}{r^3}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\vskip 20pt

Substituting \eqref{first v} and \eqref{second v} into \eqref{second partials}, and \eqref{second partials}
into the LHS of \eqref{claim}, we obtain:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{d^2 v}{d x^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d x}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d x}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
+& \frac{d^2 v}{d y^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d y}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d y}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
+& \frac{d^2 v}{d z^2} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{d v}{d z}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{d v}{d z}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
+& \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{aligned}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
=&\frac{r^2-x^2}{r^3} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + (1+\frac{x}{r})^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} (1+\frac{x}{r})^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
&+ \frac{r^2-y^2}{r^3} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{y}{r}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{y}{r}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
&+ \frac{r^2-z^2}{r^3} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \left(\frac{z}{r}\right)^2 J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{z}{r}\right)^2 J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} \\
&+ \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
=&\frac{3r^2-x^2-y^2-z^2}{r^3} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + (1+2\frac{x}{r} +\frac{x^2}{r^2} + \frac{y^2}{r^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}) J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} \\
&- \frac{1}{2} (1+2\frac{x}{r} +\frac{x^2}{r^2}+ \frac{y^2}{r^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}) J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2}
+ \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
=\frac{2}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + (2+2\frac{x}{r}) J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{2} (2+2\frac{x}{r}) J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2} + \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
=\frac{2}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + 2\frac{x+r}{r} J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{x+r}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-3/2}
+ \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{equation*}

Remembering that $v=x+r$,

%%\begin{equation*}
%%=\frac{2}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + 2\frac{x+r}{r} J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1} - \frac{1}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2}
%%+ \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
%%\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
=\frac{2}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \frac{2}{r} J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) - \frac{1}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2}
+ \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
=\frac{2}{r} J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) + \frac{1}{r} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) v^{-1/2} + \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
=\frac{2}{r} J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) + \frac{2}{r\cdot2\sqrt{v}} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) + \frac{2}{r} J_0(2\sqrt{v})
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
\label{last eq in derivation}
=\frac{2}{r} \left( J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{v}} J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) + J_0(2\sqrt{v})\right)
\end{equation}

Now, the ordinary Bessel function $J_0(x)$ satisfies:

\begin{equation*}
x^2 J_0''(x) + xJ_0'(x) + x^2J_0(x) = 0
\end{equation*}

dividing through by $x^2$ and changing variables, we get:

\begin{equation*}
J_0''(2\sqrt{v}) + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{v}}J_0'(2\sqrt{v}) + J_0(2\sqrt{v}) = 0
\end{equation*}

which shows that \eqref{last eq in derivation} is zero, and establishes the proof of \eqref{claim}.
